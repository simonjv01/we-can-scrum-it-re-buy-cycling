    <p class="intro_paragraph">We know that kids grow fast, but it's easy to keep them on a high-quality bike 
    with the new Re-Buy-Cycle program. In exchange for the donation of a gently used bike or a small monetary donation,  
    we will help you ensure that your child always has an awesome, safe bike to ride as they mature. When it's 
    time to move to a bigger size, just bring that bike back to any location and we will exchange it for a larger kidâ€™s bike - free!</p>
